This error occurs when you try to use a feature of Expo that isn't compatible with your current setup, such as using a library that requires a bare workflow or using a feature that is only available on a specific platform.  It often manifests as a cryptic error message during build or runtime.  Example (using a bare workflow feature in a managed workflow):
```javascript
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo'; // This is usually for bare workflow
registerRootComponent(App);
```
