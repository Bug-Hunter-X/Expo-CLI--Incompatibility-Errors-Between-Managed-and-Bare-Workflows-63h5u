The solution is to either use the correct workflow for your needs or to find an alternative that is compatible with your current setup.  For example, if you need to use native modules, consider using the Expo modules API instead of directly integrating native libraries into the bare workflow.  If you are using a library incompatible with managed workflow, explore alternatives that are compatible or consider ejecting to a bare workflow. Example (using Expo modules API):
```javascript
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'; // Expo module for file system operations
// use FileSystem.readAsStringAsync() instead of native filesystem functions
```
